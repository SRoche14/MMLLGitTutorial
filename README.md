<h1>Introduction to Git</h1>
<p>The goal of this repository is to guide you through the basics of git. Completing this tutorial will help you work with codebases here on GitHub and on other platforms such as GitLab.</p>

To start with, watch this high-level, 4-minute introduction to git: [How Git Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9lnsKot_SQ)

Now, onto the tutorial.

<h2>Overview of Git</h2>
**show graphics with high level places of git**

Git is the most popular source code manager (SCM). Other SCMs are used, such as [Apache Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), but Git has won the popularity contest for a variety of reasons. <br>

As most developers use Git, it is the focus of this tutorial.

You can think of Git as managing code between four locations: your local directories, the staging area, your local repository, and your repository on GitHub.

![Image showing the "four locations" and basic commands Git uses to communicate between the locations.](./images/gitHighLevel.png "How Git Manages Code - at a High Level")

<h2>Basic Commands</h2>
**introduce basic commands and their purpose**

<h2>Project 1</h2>
**put above commands into use by having students create repository and make some basic changes**

<h2>Branches, Explained</h2>
**explain how branches work, their purpose**

<h2>Project 2</h2>
**have students work with branches**

<h2>Git History</h2>
**show students how to use git history to rebase, revert, etc**

<h2>Project 3</h2>
**have students put above history management into practice**

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
**show how to use git with collaborators, particuarly on GitHub**

<h2>Project 4</h2>
create scenarios that do the following:
1) have them use a repo where collaboration works perfectly (no merge issues)
2) have them run into merge errors and walkthrough how to solve them

<h2>Further Reading</h2>
**provide info to further resources and highlight basic commands to get info such as man**

Here is an [excellent reference](https://git-scm.com/docs) on git commands.
